Last year we presented on the state of Kubernetes Security across the past, present, and future. This year, we'll continue that tradition by:
- Reviewing the major security vulnerabilities and milestones of 2019
- Reviewing progress on the Big Problems we highlighted in 2018, and highlighting other work in progress
- Looking forward to 2020 with predictions of major themes and open issues
